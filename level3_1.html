    	Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. 
    	<br>All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. 
    	<br>
    	<h3 class="gap"><em>But there is this gap.</em></h3> 
    	For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. 
    	<br>It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. 
    	<br>
    	<br>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still 
    	<h2 class="killer">killer.</h2>
    	And your taste is why your work disappoints you. 
    	<br>A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. 
    	<br>
    	<br>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. 
    	<br>We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. 
    	<br>
    	<h4 class="we"><em>We all go through this.</em></h4> 
    	And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. 
    	<br>Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. 
    	<br>It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. 
    	<br>
    	<br>And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. 
    	<br>
    	<br>It's gonna take awhile. 
    	<br>It's normal to take awhile. 
    	<br>
    	<br>You've just gotta fight your way through.
