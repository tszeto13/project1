    THE 
    <br>
    GAP

    	<br>
    	Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. 
    	<br>All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. 
    	<br>
    	<h3 class="gap"><em>But there is this gap.</em></h3>
    	For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. 
    	<br>It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not.
    	<br>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, 
    	<br>

    	<h3 class="killer"><em>is still killer.</em></h3> 
		And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. 
    	<br>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. 
    	<br>
    	<h3 class="we"><em>We all go through this.</em></h3> 
    	And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. 
    	<br>Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. 
    	<br>And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. 
    	<br>
    	<h3>It's gonna take awhile.</h3> 
    	<h3>It's normal to take awhile.</h3> 
    	<h2 class="fight"><em>You've just gotta fight your way through.</em></h2>
