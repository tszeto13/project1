    	Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. 
    	<br>
    	All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have 
    	<br>
    	<h3 class="good"><em>good taste.</em></h3>
        <br>
    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is this
    	<br>
    	<h1 class="gap"><em>gap.</em></h1> 
    	<br>
    	For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just 
    	<br>
    	<h4 class="not"><em>not</em></h4> 
    	<h3 class="that"><em>that</em></h3>
    	<h2 class="good2"><em>good.</em></h2>

    	It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. 
    	<br>
    	But your taste, 
    	<br>the thing that got you into the game, 
    	<br>
    	<h3 class="is">is</h3> 
    	<h2 class="still">still</h2> 
    	<h1 class="killer"><em>killer.</em></h1> 
    	<br>
    	And your taste is why your work disappoints you. 
    	<br>A lot of people never get past this phase, 
    	<br>
    	<h2 class="quit">they quit.</h2> 
    	<br>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. 
    	<br>We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. 
    	<br>
    	<h3 class="we"><em>We all go through this.</em></h3> 
    	And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. 
    	<br>Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. 
    	<br>It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.
    	<br> And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met.
    	<br>
    	<br>
    	<h2 class="awhile">It's gonna take awhile.</h2> 
    	
    	<h2 class="normal">It's normal to take awhile.</h2> 
    	
    	<h2 class="fight">You've just gotta fight your way through.</h2>
    	<br>
