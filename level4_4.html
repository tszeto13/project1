    <h3 class="title">THE GAP</h3>

    	<br>
    	 Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. 
    	 <br>
    	 All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. 
    	 <br>
    	 <h1 class="gap"><em>But there is this gap.</em></h1> 

    	 <br>For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. 
    	 <br>It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. 
    	 <br>But your 
    	 <br>
    	 <h1 class="taste"><em>taste,</em></h1> 
		the thing that got you into the game, 
    	 <br>is still 
    	 <br>
    	 <h1 class="killer">- killer -</h1> 
 			And your taste is why your work disappoints you. 
    	 <br>A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. 
    	 <br>
    	 <br>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. 
    	 <br>We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. 
    	 <br>
    	 <h1 class="we"><em>We all go through this.</em></h1> 
    	 <br>And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.
    	 <br> 
    	 <br>Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. 
    	 <br>It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. 
    	 <br>
    	 <br>
    	  <h3 class="longer"><em>And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. </em></h3>
    	 <br>It's gonna take awhile. 
    	 <br>It's normal to take awhile. 
    	 <br>
    	 <br>
    	 <h2 class="fight">You've just gotta fight your way through.</h2>
