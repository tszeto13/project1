    	Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. 
    	<br>All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste.
		<br> 
    	<h3>But there is this gap.</h3> 
    	For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. 
    	<br>It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. 
    	<br>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. 
    	<br>And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. 
    	<br>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. 
    	<br>We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have.
    	<br> 
    	<h3>We all go through this.</h3> 
    	And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, 
    	<br>you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. 
    	<br>Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. 
    	<br>It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, 
    	<br>and your work will be as good as your ambitions. 
    	<br>And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. 
    	<br>
        
    	<br>It's gonna take awhile. 
    	<br>It's normal to take awhile. 
    	<br>You've just gotta fight your way through.
